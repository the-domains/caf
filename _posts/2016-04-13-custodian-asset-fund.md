Custodian Asset Fund

What We Do

Who We Are
In late 2013, I recognised the growing need for investors to have access to the combined skills and experience in the areas of property & hospitality in value adding through project management, ongoing asset management and frontend management. 
To assist in this Custodian Asset Fund (CAF) was incorporated as the vehicle to provide these skills. With the necessary network of professionals Custodian Asset Fund is well placed to maximise the returns on property investments. A small but experienced property development and management company its primary focus is to achieve yield driven outcomes with strong growth from development & investment opportunities.
